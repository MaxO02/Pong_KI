# **Pong_KI**
Project maintainers: ***@MaxO02 @LetsLeppr*** This Pong game is
developed as a school project. Feel free to fork and improve. Our goal
is to create our own pong-game with all the fancy extras we need. After
we are fully satisfied with it, we will try to implement a game mode,
where you have to play a special trained AI (so basically you will lose)
in different stages of training. 

Currently we are 20 days after kickoff of our project and already have
accomplished a lot of our planned stuff. The only thing that remains to do is to
add all the fancy extras we wished for. If you can find any kind of bug
in our code, please open a new issue and describe it. Also if there is
an extra you've always wanted in a pong clone, you can open an issue and
suggest your feature.

If you only want to play, you will need to install the __PyCharm IDE__ at first. We are using it for development and as we haven't put together a standalone, this will be the only was to actually run the game. Just open the project with PyCharm and run the __init.py__ file

To create this game, we made use of the
[__pygame__](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) repository.
