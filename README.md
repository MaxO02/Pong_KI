# **Pong_KI**
Project maintainers: ***@MaxO02 @LetsLeppr*** This Pong game is
developed as a school project. Feel free to fork and improve. Our goal
is to create our own pong-game with all the fancy extras we need. After
we are fully satisfied with it, we will try to implement a game mode,
where you have to play a special trained AI (so basically you will lose)
in different stages of training. 

Currently we are 20 days after kickoff of our project and already have
accomplished a lot of our planned stuff. The only thing that remains to do is to
add all the fancy extras we wished for. If you can find any kind of bug
in our code, please open a new issue and describe it. Also if there is
an extra you've always wanted in a pong clone, you can open an issue and
suggest your feature.

To run this game there now are a few options available. 

**Pycharm**

You can check out this project with the [__PyCharm IDE__](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). There you will need to create an interpreter and install additional packages if need be. Please reade potential error outputs to get the missing packages.

**Run from Terminal**

Aswell as using PyCharm you could just clone this project to your desired directory and cd there. Just use pip install the additional packages and use the command "python3 __init__.py to run the initialization script.

**Windows Executable**

We have been able to put together a standalone Windows executable which you should find in this project. Please note that we might carry on development but won't neccessarily update the standalone every time. If you want to play the most up to date version have a look at above approaches.




To create this game, we made use of the
[__pygame__](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) repository aswell as the packages of __multitasking__. Installing those should be sufficient to run the game as non-standalone.
