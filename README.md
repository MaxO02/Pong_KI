# **Pong_KI**
Project maintainers: ***@MaxO02 @LetsLeppr*** This Pong game is
developed as a school project. Feel free to fork and improve. Our goal
is to create our own pong-game with all the fancy extras we need. After
we are fully satisfied with it, we will try to implement a game mode,
where you have to play a special trained AI (so basically you will lose)
in different stages of training. 

To create this game, we made use of the
[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) repository.

Currently we are 20 days after kickoff of our project and already have accomplished a lot of our planned stuff. Right now there are no bugs whatsoever that we know about. The only thing that remains to do is to add all the fancy extras we wished for. If you can find any kind of bug in our code, please open a new issue and describe it. Also if there is an extra you've always wanted in a pong clone, you can open a pull request and suggest your feature.
